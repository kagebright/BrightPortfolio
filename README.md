# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description
In this week's assignment, I needed to a make a porttfolio to showcase all my projects current and future projects in my coding careers. I learned a lot about frontend engineering while I was making this porfolio. I had some difficulties designing some parts such as the hovering and also making the pages responsive. Overall, it was a good learning experience.
